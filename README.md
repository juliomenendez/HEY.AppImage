# HEY Mail for Linux packaged in an AppImage

I've been having issues with the HEY Linux application that's distributed via the Snap store. It wouldn't open at times 
making me uninstall it and install it again. After trying multiple times to figure out what the issue was, I decided to
move it out of the Snap system to debug it. Running it outside it made it work consistently and without hiccups. 

That's when I decided to make it an AppImage to integrate it correctly in my system, GNOME.

At the moment I build the AppImage manually but I want to see if that can be automated in Github Actions.
